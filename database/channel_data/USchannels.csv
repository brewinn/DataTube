Welcome to my Channel! This is the start of hopefully a loooong career of entertaining make videos. Though this channel is still fairly new I have been on Youtube for a long time. My older channel is ""Foam and tape"" if you want to go check it out! 

Back on Track, This channel is more of a kickstart to where I want to be and what I want to do.

I know I have something to offer and honestly I'd love to be a part of the maker orientated part of YT. So feel free to subscribe and comment! (sharing the videos helps too!!)

As of now I'm more focused on making good content rather than a fixed schedule of release dates. With that being said I try and make one a week give or take a day or two.

 His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing;, ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

I’m With Her is Sara Watkins, Sarah Jarosz and Aoife O’Donovan. Since 2015, the trio has toured the world together and formed a special, family-like chemistry, garnering acclaim for their unique blend of instrumental interplay combined with their indelible harmonies, as the New York Times describes, “... that could be sweetly ethereal, or as tightly in tandem as country sibling teams like the Everly Brothers, or as hearty as mountain gospel.” Their debut album, See You Around, was recorded in Bath, England, with Ethan Johns at Real World Studios.

I’m standing with my siblings in our apartment in Thamesmead estate, a public-housing complex in Southeast London. I have a little Afro and brown skin, and I’m wearing Michael Jackson-style shorts. Beside me are my very blond and blue-eyed brother and four sisters. I’m drawn to this photo because it reminds me of how often I’ve felt like an outsider—both as a child and later as an adult. 

As a kid, I didn’t realize that being an outsider gave me a passport to be different.

alt-J,http://www.youtube.com/user/Altjband,1.15M subscribers,"857,648,852 views","Sep 21, 2011","The official YouTube channel of alt-J. Subscribe for the latest music videos, performances, and more.

After winning the Mercury Prize in 2012 with their debut album An Awesome Wave, Joe Newman [vocals, guitar], Gus Unger-Hamilton [vocals, keyboards, bass] and Thom Sonny Green [drums, percussion] made the Grammy-nominated This Is All Yours (2014) and followed it with Relaxer (2017). 

The Dream, alt-J’s fourth album, began life on schedule when the band first regrouped at their own studio, a rented house in east London where they write and record. Navigating Covid as it arrived and hung around – with Green shielding throughout the pandemic and often working remotely, The Dream was recorded from August 2020 until June 2021 with long-time producer Charlie Andrew. What emerged was a record of intrigue and ambiguity that fizzes with a rejuvenated sense of experimentalism.

As also it the opportunity to interest and attention people to motorsports and show people from around the world, racing series from around the world.
3 years in a row (2016-2018) 95% of all videos were uploaded in real time.
Be sure to watch the playlists (there are selected videos by racing series or classes). 

I'm not a fan of crashes, despite the name of the channel. The main problem is that can't upload large videos or full races (so, basically, on this channel only short videos - the most interesting moments).

I remind that the channel has no monetization and any income from YouTube. If you are the copyright holder and consider that your rights have been violated, please write about it under the video and I will delete it within 48 hours."

It’s also the rare narrative record that’s songs also stand as strongly alone as they do in sequenced order. “I was still in the PARANOIA headspace, and I didn’t want to leave it, but as we made these songs, you can hear me growing and going deeper than I ever have before,” Maggie notes. “Even if some of the melodies changed or production elements took new form, a lot of SUCKERPUNCH is as we originally wrote and intended it – songs that showcase the new version of who I’ve always wanted to be.”

Here I share my journey, other stories, vlogs and my travels!

I was born the small city, Arkhangelsk, Russia in 1992. I was then adopted into my New Zealand family when I was two years old after spending two years inside a Russian orphanage. In 2013, I traced and met my birth parents for the first time and in 2015, I founded I'm Adopted, an organisation for other adoptees to connect globaly. 

I am trying to grow my connection more with my birth mother who didn’t have a family herself. Her own roots come from Ukraine and Kazakhstan, which I am still helping connect the dots with for her.

I share the life of my Birth Father Mihkail (Misha), who didn’t know I was born until I connected with him for the first time.

But since I was elected to office I've learned first hand that even a single person can actually make a big difference if they choose to. I want people to see what politics is like on the inside, and how people really do have the power to change things if they pay attention and learn which political levers to pull to make things happen.

Today I serve as a State Representative in the Hawaii State Legislature. I've been fortunate to have helped lead the fight to successfully pass laws making Hawaii a national leader on renewable energy, climate change, equal rights, and building a fair and just 21st century economy that leaves no one behind. Now I'm working to engage more people, especially our next generation, to get involved and help change politics to build a better future for us all."

I like to make videos on all the crazy stuff I do. From exploding arrows, to making instruments, molten aluminum to science/chemistry experiments - I do it so you don't have to! I'm always thinking of more stuff to do, if you have an idea, id love to hear it!

Almost everything I do can be considered dangerous!!  If you insist on trying my videos at home, just remember- if you play with fire, you're going to get burned. Electricity is deadly. Be safe guys :)

I love email from subscribers!

You are free to share / upload my videos on social media (FB,Instagram,Twitter,etc...) 
Only if:
- you do not run ads on the video or page it's played on (No websites or YT uploads) Reactions, using clips in YT videos is OK as long as it doesn't violate the spirit of FAIR USE.
- you credit my YouTube channel AND tag the corresponding social media site.
- you may not sell my videos or edits of videos under any circumstance. 

Anything else, email me."

We test and use affordable electronic soldering equipment and tools to build, teardown, modify (and sometimes destroy) random electronic stuff.

A British TV licence is NOT required to view my videos or almost every other video on YouTube.

Many of the builds and projects featured here operate at full mains voltage and carry a high risk of shock and fire.  As such they're really intended for either entertainment value or for those who do similar stuff.
The videos are generally uncensored and may contain tasteless jokes, profanities and even blood and electric shocks when things go wrong.  So just like a normal workshop really.

So kick back, grab a beer and enjoy the ride."

I still remember the star sparks of fire, carried away to their heavenly brothers, and the warm light of the heated metal suddenly became pliable in children's hands. It was then, in the twilight of the polar night, the fire gave me spiritual harmony, from the ability to change the world around, he gave me the power to hear steel.

2) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  Then I created Digital Dudz (made some videos about this too) and eventually sold it after 2 years.  Then I worked for Apple in their Special Projects Group doing Product Design as a Mechanical Engineer for 5 years.  As of 2019, I just make my monthly YouTube videos.

I live for street food and local food, and I'm traveling to taste it. I'm a hungry traveler that's currently living abroad in Chengdu, Sichuan China,  eating as much delicious food as I can.

So far, I've eaten and filmed street food and local cuisine in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Eating the same food as local Chinese, Malaysian, or Thai people has showed me that it's best to travel almost solely for the food! My dream is to keep eating and traveling the world forever, a non-stop adventure!  I live to travel, and I know you do too! I love eating street foods and culinary treats while learning about new cultures!

Food is different around the world, and I want to share it with you. Food is something that connects us all, and to me, food is the best way to connect and have a true cultural experience!

Some were Holland natives, and others had come to attend local colleges and universities. While the original Holland nucleus has now dispersed to various parts of the country, the fellowship is still growing, with new friends and shared projects with other independent labels. Asthmatic Kitty is now based in Lander, Wyoming, Indianapolis, Indiana and New York City.

Asthmatic Kitty was named after Sara, a voluptuous orange and white longhair who wandered out of the woods in 1995, pregnant, starving, and afflicted with various parasites and ailments, including feline asthma. Although she still wheezes a bit, especially when being chased by her sister Tabby, Sara today enjoys a healthy and happy life of luxury. Cast-off animals make the best pets!"

It's a shoddy practice and I'm not over the moon about it. What else. 

Oh yeah. I have a book out called Dot Con that was reprinted in the USA and it's a hardback which made me feel important. And you can buy it from a small independent bookseller or a massive conglomerate that delivers straight to your door and we all feel collectively guilty about. 

AND YES you SHOULD buy the game of Lockdown that I made and also watch my TED talks on ted.com and, ok, I've talked myself into it you should probs subscribe.

As a blacksmith, most of the projects start as lumps of steel, or stacks of different alloys for making damascus, that I forge out into blades, sculpture, art or tools before taking the project to the machining equipment or into the grinding room for finishing. Each project teaches me a lot and stretches the bounds of my knowledge. I make a lot of mistakes but they serve as an excellent teacher. There's always something important for me to learn in the shop! 

I want my work to be the spark that ignites the desire for you to get into your shop (or kitchen/basement/garage) and make something too! Whether it's stitching a leather wallet or forging a giant sword, you'll love the creative process.

Occasional videos of these other eras may be uploaded by other writers who are more familiar of them.

THE MUSIC OF A MOVEMENT

At Reach, our passion is changing the way people see the world. The reason we create music and media, and travel the world to hit stages big and small is not simply to be successful. Our goal has always been the hearts of the people.

Our hope lies in the person and work of Jesus. If this man was a mere teacher our work would be influenced by him. Yet he claims to be God and change the hearts of humanity. That is the message we bring. Everyone is preaching something, whether it's the gospel of money, power and sex, or even education and the American dream.  We aim to serve through art, to bring healing and show others a different way to view their world.

The heartbeat of Reach is Romans 1:16 ""For I am not ashamed of the gospel for is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.""

Are you Unashamed?  Join the movement."

His use of deeply personal lyrics tells relatable stories about love, loss, addiction and rebirth. 

Throughout his prolific career, he has been immersed in the LA scene working closely with artists such as Machine Gun Kelly, Blackbear, & G-Eazy while simultaneously collaborating with some of the biggest names in rap, like ScHoolboy Q and Nipsey Hussle. However, since releasing his alternative anthems, I Remember Way Too Much and Stay Away ft Machine Gun Kelly & Goody Grace, he has accumulated tens of millions of streams online, and received co-signs from some of the biggest names in rock and roll like John Feldmann and Travis Barker."

I don’t have a Filipino passport and it would be almost impossible for me to get one. Truth is I will never be able to say “I am Filipino”. But there are so many simple beautiful things that I have experienced and witnessed that make up Filipino culture… Things that I would be honoured to learn from, and be honoured to share with the world around me.

Since our beginning in 2015, I have interviewed hundreds of people across the world while providing over $1,300,000 to those featured on this channel through a combination of grants and fundraising. 

Starting in 2016, SBSK is now a 501(c)3 organization that seeks to normalize the diversity of the human condition under the pillars of honesty, respect, mindfulness, positivity and collaboration. This multi-media movement supports the acceptance and inclusion of all members of the neurodiverse/disability community regardless of diagnosis, age, race, religion, income, sexual orientation, gender or gender expression.

-

You don't sell over two million copies of your debut album without some serious hard work, and Australian singer/songwriter Vance Joy has never been shy of major elbow grease. Vance Joy (born James Keogh) made a first impression with anthems 'Riptide', ‘Mess is Mine’, ‘Georgia’ and ‘Fire and the Flood’. Those hits all found a home on the 2014's debut ’dream your life away’. 

Come July 2017 – Vance Joy kicked off the campaign for his Sophomore album ‘Nation of Two’ with the lead single ‘Lay It On Me’ showing it was destined to be another successful album. The track was followed six months later with the album and follow up single ‘Saturday Sun’, a tune so good that he held up delivering Nation of Two to ensure it made the cut. 

2021 brings new music for Vance Joy with 'Missing Piece', the track has already gone GOLD in Australia.

The earlier videos served to teach me how to make a video, as I have no background in filming, editing, etc. That early content was following trends of the time, learning how best to approach my lack of understanding of video.

Founded in 2010, RESSENCE is a unique watchmaker creating innovative mechanical fine-watches. 

We represent an independent way of thinking about fine watchmaking - no less expertly hand-crafted, but with an industrial design philosophy that seeks to be progressive with a clear, graphic aesthetic that is decidedly 21st century. 

All RESSENCE share the same inimitable DNA. Their sub-dials continually revolve, as does the main disc into which they are set - like moons in orbit around a planet. 

This means that our watch's uncluttered dial is ever-changing - as is everything in Time."

I managed to do this working a lot less than many think you need to with entrepreneurship.

I believe entrepreneurs can work less & have more fun when building a company. That makes it more sustainable. 

My mission is a simple one: to make entrepreneurs surcharged by helping them work less & have more fun.

In case you don't know who I am.... 

I DRIVE a BMW i8..... 

and I spend a lot of time WATCHING... TALKING ABOUT.. and DRIVING cool cars.. 
You might have seen me on your screens already hosting ESPN F1, Formula E, Goodwood and SuperCharged. 

My channel will include TWO things: 
 
1. BEHIND THE SCENES:
I'll be sharing some of the things that I get up to when I'm on the road filming. Expect behind the scenes at race weekends, driver features, super car test drives....and a bit of tech so you can channel your inner geek! 

2. SHIELDS DRIVES: 
As I mentioned, I drive a BMW i8 and because it's the time of year for giving, I thought I should share some of the enjoyment I get out of my car.. So, I have devised a cunning plan.... I'm starting a series called 'SHIELDS DRIVES' - I will be posting questions online about my i8. 

If YOU guess the RIGHT answer to a question about my i8, YOU could be the NEXT PASSENGER...

A term we all use to describe something incredibly difficult. Trying to grasp all of the concepts involved in rocket science can be incredibly intimidating.

My name’s Tim Dodd but I'm better known as the Everyday Astronaut. Recently I fell head over heels in love with spaceflight. My appreciation and curiosity for the subject grew into an obsession. Before you knew it, all I wanted to do was learn more and more... the more I learned, the more I wanted to share what was making me so excited. 

But as someone who dropped out of college and has no technical background or degree… I really felt unqualified for the job of explaining rocket science to anyone. But the fact of the matter is, if I can learn this stuff, anyone can. 

Rocket science is awesome, and you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to be excited.

According to will.i.am, her brand savviness and respect for the music industry couldn’t have been any more perfect.

__________________________________

Catch an all-new episode of 9-1-1 Monday 8/7c on FOX! 🚨

Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear reimagine the procedural drama with ""9-1-1."" The series explores the high-pressure experiences of first responders -- including police officers, firefighters and dispatchers -- who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. The show draws from real-life, high-pressure experiences of first responders who regularly face heart-stopping situations that are often unpredictable, intense and uplifting at the same time.

In 2018, twenty-three transformative anti-corruption laws, from anti-gerrymandering and ranked choice voting to sweeping ethics and transparency laws, were passed in cities and states—more than in any other year in our nation’s history. No more politics as usual.

Their catalogue boasts the Mercury Prize nominated self-titled debut album released in 2014 that spawned hits such as ""Out of the Black, ""Little Monster:, ""Come On Over"" and ""Figure it Out"", as well as their second successive UK number one album ""How Did We Get So Dark?"" released in 2017 which featured ""Lights Out"" and ""I Only Lie When I Love You"".

He became interested in music after listening to artists like The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, and Method Man. At the age of 7, he began creating rhymes and, by 10 years old, he recorded his first track at a local studio. He attended South High Community School in Worcester.   

He signed to Atlantic Records on September 21, 2016. Joyner gained national attention when he appeared on the 2015 BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher. He was the first artist to be moved from the web platform of the show to the televised syndication.   After exiting his career at Atlantic Records in December of 2018, Joyner set forward to continue his career as an independent artist, writing and distributing his music through his start-up Tully.

We grew up singing harmonies in a big family, taught by our mom, a classical pianist. In 2009, we posted a cover of Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From there,, we were discovered by a manager and signed with UMG under Island Records. We moved to L.A. in 2010, where we lived and worked in the pop music world for 5 years, before getting burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn’t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville in 2015 to become independent artists. 

We have since released 5 albums of original music, toured the U.S., South America and Europe, performed at international festivals, written a book, Believe In You, started a podcast and reached over 1 billion views on our channel. Our goal with our channel is to make videos and music that are positive, uplifting and innovative. Thank you for being here, and for being a part of our amazing supporters, the Cim Fam!

Growing up, I knew first hand how it feels to not always fit in. That’s actually why I originally created Azzyland in my mind. It was my sanctuary, an escape where everyone is treated with kindness and love. Then something I never imagined possible happened, it became real. It grew into a living, breathing community that connects millions of people through a platform of positivity. A place where everyone is encouraged to embrace and express the truest version of themselves.

That’s why my goal with this channel is to inspire positive change and to create a home for those who need a friend, for those who need a laugh, and for those who need a moment to not focus on what’s happening in their lives.
